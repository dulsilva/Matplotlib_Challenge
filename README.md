MatPlotLib_challenge: Plots and Pharmaceuticals

In this challenge we can see the importance of plots in story telling. In this Challenge we will take plotting into the Pharmaceutical industry and see how storytelling can helpanalyze raw data. 

In this challenge we will compare the drug Capomulin to another 9 drugs that will be treated on mice that have tumors. The data will give us numbers to read on the effectiveness of these drugs on mice and the vokume of the tumors but that is only have of the analysis. Through Bar Charts, Pie Charts, and other graphs we can take a look at visuals that represent the data and give us a clear picture of the treatment results.
